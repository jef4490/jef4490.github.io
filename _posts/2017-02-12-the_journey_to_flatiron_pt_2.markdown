  The statistics were intimidating. Most of these bootcamps boasted acceptance rates under 10%. Now, obviously it’s a little different from college admissions because applications are free, easy to fill out, and there’s no guarantee of follow-up on the part of the student. Still 5% of all applications submitted made me realize I needed to get my stuff together. I read up a lot about the App Academy admissions process and the fact that it was accommodating to people with a wide range of prep material familiarity meant that the difficulty could scale based on how much experience coding you had. I wasn’t ready to start a bootcamp anytime soon and admissions were limited to the next 2 classes (meaning I couldn’t apply to a class in 2017 yet). Feeling I was getting fairly good at solving practice problems, and wanted to be judged on the scale of a beginner, I made the major mistake of putting my coding on hold. I left it for several months and when I think back about what I might have done different, this is the single biggest thing that comes to mind. I regret not having had the foresight and opportunity to keep learning and practicing, but it’s the decision I made at the time.

	
  It was the late summer when I came back. I was forgetting the syntax, and decided that I might try a new course to recall the details. I also decided to get serious about applying to a bootcamp and needed to decide on the specific ones to which I would apply. These two intersecting needs led me to Learn, the Flatiron School’s online coding platform. I signed up for the Ruby course and began working on it. I found it the be night and day compared to CodeAcademy. For one, the course asked a great deal more logical leaping from the user. That is, where CodeAcademy would explain that to get from A to C, the proper path to take would be A -> B -> C, and then break down A -> B. Learn explained what functionality C would provide, and then included tests to verify the individual elements of the solution, but it was up to you to find the path there. For me, that was a great thing. Like App Academy’s practice problems, it taught me to think programmatically. And that was why I applied to Flatiron first. 

  The rest is history.
